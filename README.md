You can download the .exe file to run the command line application directly. If you run the .exe, you don't need to have Python installed or have any command line experience. 

Please note (as I explain in the app) that you'll have to use Rhubarb Lip Sync from the command line separately to produce the text output you'll use in the Quill Viseme Helper:

I have not tested this extensively, so please reach out if you are having trouble and I can troubleshoot and/or make modifications! If a Quill template or video instructions would be helpful, please let me know and I can put something simple together. 

And if anyone would like me to update this so it can handle Papagayo output as well, please contact me.
